mtbRPG: virtual mountain biking!

compile using "make"
run using "./final"

# Ruan Abarbanel
# CSCI 4229

## my program has two scenes

## The first is an elevated plane intended to simulate a mountain with various trees, rocks, a stream, grass, a trail, and wooden walkways populating it.

## This world is randomly generated using an assortment of rules:

### PRESS R TO RE-INITIALIZE WORLD AND VIEW SOMETHING RANDOM AND NEW
### PRESS R TO RE-INITIALIZE WORLD AND VIEW SOMETHING RANDOM AND NEW
### PRESS R TO RE-INITIALIZE WORLD AND VIEW SOMETHING RANDOM AND NEW

1. The terrain samples semi-random elevation data then smoothes itself out using a averaging algorithm. The landscape will always be tend higher elevation towards the left and right edges while always moving steadily downhill.

2. The trail itself navigates the trees and river by either avoiding it or placing a wooden walkway over.

3. The river follows the next lowest point starting from the furthest back row of the lanscape mesh.

4. Rocks and grass are randomly dispersed and have their own rules for size of the "patch" and reach.

5. Trees are distributed so that the trail (in the middle) has the least frequency while it increases towards the outside of the map

### The mountain world is made to feel alive with various animations in the grass, trees, and water. To simulate wind and gravity.


## The second world is a test space for the various objects in the scene.
### Use n to switch to the test space and b to swap items in the test space.

# Key Controls

m : change modes (First Person, Perspective, Orthogonal)
n : change scene (Mountain, Testing Zone)
b : change items (Test Space Only)

p : pauses time so you can view light normals at any instance peferred

r : re-initialize scene (this can help you quickly see different orientations of the terrain)

arrow keys: Change view angle up/down and left/right

w a s d: move through world in first person mode

0 : reset viewing angle and first person player position to (0,0)

l : toggle light

t : toggle axes

- : decrease FOV
= : increas FOV


## Some Controls for Perspective Mode ONLY

, : zoon out
. : zoom in

ESC : close window and terminate program
